To confirm the plugin is working correctly:

1. Open the **AI for WooCommerce > Status** page in your admin panel.

2. Check that your storeâ€™s **public endpoints** (products, categories, posts) are accessible.

3. Use the **Test MCP Connection** button to verify compatibility with AI assistants (e.g., Claude).

4. Ensure no customer or private data appears in the exposed endpoints.
