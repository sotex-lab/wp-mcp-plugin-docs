**Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP)** is an open standard created by **OpenAI** and **Stripe** that enables smooth interaction between AI agents, buyers, and businesses to complete purchases. It allows merchants to offer instant checkout across **web, iOS and Android**, while supporting multiple payment methods like **cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay, Link by Stripe** and more coming soon.

With ACP, merchants keep full control of their customer relationships—handling **orders, payments, and post-purchase experiences** directly—while AI agents help guide buyers and keep them informed in real time. The protocol is **flexible, secure**, and designed to **integrate easily** with existing commerce systems, making it simple to reach **new customers** through AI-driven channels.
