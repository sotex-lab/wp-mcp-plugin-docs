**MCP-Integrate** plugin supports the **Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP)**. It provides **two dedicated endpoints** to help you manage ACP integration:

* **List ACP-Compatible Products** – Returns all products that are currently ACP-compliant, ready to be used with AI agents for seamless purchases.

* **Check ACP Compliance** – Identifies what is missing or required for each product to become fully ACP-compatible, helping you quickly update your catalog.

This makes it easy to ensure your product catalog is ready for **AI-driven** commerce and **Instant Checkout** experiences.
